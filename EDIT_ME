* Awareness:
Awareness can refer to various things.
- It can refer to noticing things. [[As noticing|(More)]]
- It can also refer to keeping track of things over time. [[As tracking|(More)]]
There are many related topics.

As noticing:
Awareness can refer to noticing details and occurrences that are subtle.
- It can mean noticing the emotional valence of thoughts and statements.
- It can mean recognizing the significance or category of a given occurrence, such as something being fortunate, or a person’s action being one choice out of several which may reflect on their character, etc.
Various ideas and habits can improve this faculty.

As tracking:
Awareness can refer to the process of keeping track of specific recollections in monitoring general themes.
For example, a person might know for any given time span:
- The most fortunate things that happened to him.
- His greatest accomplishments.
- His greatest challenges and those of his friends and relatives.
- His strongest positive and negative sentiments.
These sorts of things are “awareness” but have more to do with organizing facts than noticing them in the first place.
There are more things like these and habits that contribute to awareness of them.


* Bias:
Bias can refer to situations where our position affects our perspective or may do so.
There are many kinds of biases:
- Biases that are related to self-interest.
- Biases that may have a biological basis.
- Biases that healthy and happy people have. [[Healthy|(More)]]
A focus on bias might characterize recent cultural and philosophical movements.
There are many related topics.

Healthy:
There are certain biases which are conducive to mental health and happiness, for example:
- Bias towards the positives of one's circumstance and past decisions as opposed to ruminating about alternatives.
- Bias towards the positives of other people.
- Bias towards the positives of one's spouse and family.
Cultural movements that emphasize awareness of bias may insufficiently distinguish between healthy and unhealthy bias.
There are many related topics.


* Conformity:
Every member of a group or community deals with the existence of norms and ideals and to what extent to adopt them.
There are different situations and different types of conformity that may be advisable or inadvisable.
One related point is that if one prides oneself on one's integration into a group, one's self-esteem can become conditional on one's reception from the group, which can be undesirable even in situations where conformity is desirable.
Conforming without becoming emotionally dependent on a group requires verbalizing an identity and values other than membership in the group, and reminding oneself periodically that group membership is merely a means to achieving those goals and values.


* Dopamine:
Dopamine is the neurotransmitter associated with goal-oriented satisfaction and addiction.
There are various questions to discuss about dopamine, eg:
- In what sense is dopamine release by media exposure artificial, but that of social interactions not?
- Is more dopamine good?
- What causes high or low dopamine availability?
There are many related topics.


* High Self-esteem:
High self-esteem can impact a person in various ways.
- It can make a person shrug off annoyances more easily.
- It can give a person greater will power to maintain higher standards.
- It can give a person motivation to continue accomplishment in their strong areas.
- It allows a person to acknowledge and work on their weak areas.
- It allows a person to appreciate people with strengths he may lack.
There are things that cause high self-esteem, ways to recognize it, and other related topics.


* Judgement:
Judgement broadly speaking is when we try to evaluate whether another person is doing well or poorly.
The primary difficulty is that a person is a success or failure relative to their effort and not natural abilities, and yet it is almost impossible to know whether a person is able to do better than they are.
You may see evidence that a person is lazy, but that laziness might be a result of bad education or demotivating experiences.
You may think you are praise-worthy for how much you do, but you may have ulterior motives another person doesn't have.
In general it is best to assume one doesn’t know what others are capable of, but the ramifications of this idea are very broad and can be difficult to fully integrate into one’s thoughts and practices.


* Kavod:
What is kavod? What is the desire for kavod psychologically? How does it relate to being needed and developing one’s strengths?
Is doing something for kavod wrong? When is it problematic and when not?


* Low Self-esteem:
Low self-esteem is a prevalent phenomena that affects most areas of a person's life.
Low self-esteem can:
- Make it difficult or uncomfortable for someone to notice the positive qualities of peers.
- Make it harder to enjoy interactions with people and with Hashem.
- Make annoyances more bothersome.
A person can feel small without feeling guilt or regret for anything. [[Doesn't entail regret|(More)]]
There are many reasons why low self-esteem is prevalent in today's world. [[Modern prevalence|(More)]]

Doesn't entail regret:
Low self-esteem is not necessarily the same thing as feeling one is a moral or practical failure.
Feelings of guilt, e.g, entail that I feel I have done something wrong which I could have avoided.
But low self-esteem, by contrast, is just the belief that one is small or insignificant, and doesn’t necessarily entail that one things one did anything wrong, or that things could have been otherwise.
Low self-esteem is less an analyitical opinion that one is “bad” than a sensory-level picture of reality in which one is small or lacking value, and so it is hard to remove without changing one’s perception of the world and one’s place in it.

Modern prevalence:
There are many aspects of the modern world that contribute to low self-esteem:
- Globalization means there is more competition and so it is harder to be important and needed, economically or communally.
- Corporatization means that the impact and role of the individual is smaller, and less autonomy means one’s contribution to success is smaller.
- Technology makes many tasks easier, leading a person to have produced a smaller portion of the outcome.
- Communications technology makes us more aware of the accomplishments of other people.
- Media proliferation makes it easier to broadcast norms and expectations of large groups.
- Postmodernism increases people-analysis and identifies more areas to find fault.
- Contemporary psychological problems can make a person less capable without being correctly identified
- Exposure to secularism dullens the emotional reality of one’s theological significance, even for religious people.
There are many other examples and related topics.


* Marriage:
Marriage is a complex topic with many subtopics.
The Jewish conception of marriage has roles for men and women.
One aspect is the idea of the woman as having a supporting role and less authority.
A corresponding responsibility of the husband is to take active responsibility for the physical and emotional well-being of everyone in the household.
You find men who expect a wife to be supporting and submissive, but who don’t take full and active responsibility for their well-being, and the mistake is to think that the two aspects are unrelated, as if to say “I may be being a _bad_ husband, but you’re being _not_ a wife,” etc.
There are cultures and hashkafas where the roles are less distinct, usually expecting less submission from the wife, and correspondingly less singular responsibility from the husband.


* Memory:
What are the kinds of memory? What behaviors/experiences produce what kinds of memories?
Complex cognitive behavior is usually the verbalization and recording of metadata to allow dumb access rather than memory “doing” analysis. [[Does not perform analysis|(More)]]

Does not perform analysis:
Memory only stores data and cannot perform analysis like inference.
Let’s say I notice ploni is hard working, and am surprised because he is usually lazy. This comparison did not occur because “memory” noticed the contradiction, rather, I had previously labeled Ploni as “lazy,” and so when my parser attributed to him the descriptor “hard-working,” this produced a patent contradiction between the stored value and current label. This would be detected in working memory which has access to the stored and new values, all memory is doing is dumb recall of the previous descriptions of ploni.


* Open-mindedness:
“Open-mindedness” can refer to a variety of qualities.
One meaning is someone who is happy to consider the views of others even if contradictory to his own.
This can be positive as one can double check one’s own conclusions.
On the other hand, such a perspective can lead someone to take the middle ground between one's view and other's from caution, and this can cause a person not to act in accordance with either view,


* Parenting:
What parenting practices produce what qualities in children?
For example, what qualities produce idealism and agency? Perhaps asking a child how they think things should be, so as to _mechayev_ them, and asking what they notice and what opinions their observations lead them to.


* Personality:
What are the types of personality, and what descriptions depict them?
Specifically, what terms for personality traits are commonly used and understood, and which traits seem correlated with one another?
Which traits are usually the product of upbringing and culture, and which are usually genetic?
What theories of personality exist, what traits do they identify, and how can we make a more general merger of them?


* Taivas:
A person has many taivas depending on biology and stage of life.
Knowing what taivas a person might have is important for identifying ulterior motives.
Taivas can be channeled towards positive behaviors, even those indirectly related to the taiva. [[Channeling|(More)]]

Channeling:
Taivas can be helpful if directed towards useful goals.
Obviously they can be directed towards related goals, like hunger motivating a person to find food.
But taivas can also be directed towards indirectly related goals. For example, a person might have a taiva for money, and they might channel this towards motivation to do school work or repetitive business tasks.
The primary difficulty in channeling a taiva is that the base drive lacks an abstract sense of what things might assist in attaining the desired thing. It can help to verbalize and visualize the connection between the behavior and the goal. However, sometimes we do get involved in means that do not so clearly contribute to the given end, and losing motivation for them is a desired behavior.
This sort of self-talk is similar to a prime minister argues to different parties how cooperation with rival parties in the coalition will deliver them outcomes more valuable to them than what they’ll give up.


* Yeshivish:
What are the various things meant by the term “yeshivish”?
What qualities identify members of the yeshiva world, and which are coincidental?
How do the morays of the contemporary yeshiva world relate to the ideals of the Torah?


* Yiddishkeit:
There are a lot of topics related to Yiddishkeit.
One topic would be the different ways a person can understand the nature of Yiddishkeit.
For example, a person might identify with a culture that does a lot of mitzvos, learning, chesed, etc, and he might truly try to excel, but what he is excelling at is conformity to the ideal member of the group.
Another person might derive from first principles what behaviors and outcomes Yiddishkeit wants, and might try to maximize those outcomes. This latter person might identify novel ways to accomplish the goals of Yiddishkeit and may be more intrinsically motivated because goal-oriented, but is probably more likely to be wrong than someone conforming to the ideal of a larger group.
