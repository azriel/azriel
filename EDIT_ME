* Awareness:
Awareness can refer to various things.
- It can refer to noticing things. [[As noticing|(more)]]
- It can also refer to keeping track of things over time. [[As tracking|(more)]]
There are many related topics.

As noticing:
Awareness can refer to noticing details and occurrences that are subtle.
- It can mean noticing the emotional valence of thoughts and statements.
- It can mean recognizing the significance or category of a given occurrence, such as something being fortunate, or a person’s action being one choice out of several which may reflect on their character, etc.
Various ideas and habits can improve this faculty.

As tracking:
Awareness can refer to the process of keeping track of specific recollections in monitoring general themes.
For example, a person might know for any given time span:
- The most fortunate things that happened to him.
- His greatest accomplishments.
- His greatest challenges and those of his friends and relatives.
- His strongest positive and negative sentiments.
These sorts of things are “awareness” but have more to do with organizing facts than noticing them in the first place.
There are more things like these and habits that contribute to awareness of them.


* Bias:
Bias can refer to situations where our position affects our perspective or may do so.
There are many kinds of biases:
- Biases that are related to self-interest.
- Biases that may have a biological basis.
- Biases that healthy and happy people have. [[Healthy|(more)]]
A focus on bias might characterize recent cultural and philosophical movements.
There are many related topics.

Healthy:
There are certain biases which are conducive to mental health and happiness, for example:
- Bias towards the positives of one’s circumstance and past decisions as opposed to ruminating about alternatives.
- Bias towards the positives of other people.
- Bias towards the positives of one’s spouse and family.
Cultural movements that emphasize awareness of bias may insufficiently distinguish between healthy and unhealthy bias.
There are many related topics.


* Caffeine:
Caffeine is an interesting topic.
It seems to me caffeine works by making more dopamine available to reward goal-completion. That explains why caffeine makes a person more productive.
However, it seems to me as if dopamine encourages top-down goal oriented thoughts, which takes attention away from things like awareness of physical sensations, sensory input, other people’s states of mind, and davening, which all involve a bottom-up inking of something that isn’t particularly stimulating or pleasurable, and so is pushed out by anything more engaging.
So, caffeine might have a side effect of reducing a person’s ability to engage in these activities.


* Conformity:
Every member of a group or community deals with the existence of norms and ideals and to what extent to adopt them.
There are different situations and different types of conformity that may be advisable or inadvisable.
One related point is that if one prides oneself on one‘s integration into a group, one’s self-esteem can become conditional on one’s reception from the group, which can be undesirable even in situations where conformity is desirable.
Conforming without becoming emotionally dependent on a group requires verbalizing an identity and values other than membership in the group, and reminding oneself periodically that group membership is merely a means to achieving those goals and values.


* Depression:
Depression is a complex phenomenon.
Similar to anxiety, various mental forces are able to trigger depression in order to further their agenda.
For example, if a goal requires isolation and part of me doesn’t want that, it can trigger depression so I have less motivation to pursue that goal.
Depression could also be a response to not having a desirable status in some area in which one is emotionally invested.


* Dopamine:
Dopamine is the neurotransmitter associated with goal-oriented satisfaction and addiction.
There are various questions to discuss about dopamine, eg:
- In what sense is dopamine release by media exposure artificial, but that of social interactions not?
- Is more dopamine good?
- What causes high or low dopamine availability?
There are many related topics.


* Gratitude:
BE"H I’d like to sketch out here aspects of life that everyone benefits from, eg:
- Every invention we rely on, what life was like before, the details, why the invention wasn’t a feit acompli
- Aspects of nature that we rely on eg crops and how much it would cost to engineer replacements
- Aspects of daily life that are pleasant and enumerating them, and ways they could be worse
Etc. In conjunction, a person can make certain types of personal lists:
- The historical arc that led to them and their family being where they are now
- At each stage of life, things that went positively
Etc.


* High Self-esteem:
High self-esteem can impact a person in various ways.
- It can make a person shrug off annoyances more easily.
- It can give a person greater will power to maintain higher standards.
- It can give a person motivation to continue accomplishment in their strong areas.
- It allows a person to acknowledge and work on their weak areas.
- It allows a person to appreciate people with strengths he may lack.
There are things that cause high self-esteem, ways to recognize it, and other related topics.


* Identification:
A person besides having traits and behaviors also identifies with some in particular.
One finds communities that identify with having high standards in mitzvos bein adam l’makom. So long as they also are yotze in bein adam l’chavero, is there any problem with that? It seems to me that there is no way for a group to identify with a subset of Yiddishkeit and not have the other parts suffer, because to identify with some subset of Yiddishkeit explicitly is to disidentify with the rest of yiddishkeit, ie, not to say one doesn’t have to be yotze, but to say that one’s membership in the group is not jeapordized by extremely lack-luster performance in them. What is the alternative? Perhaps to only have groups that identify with the entirety of Yiddishkeit and allow individuals and smaller groups to focus on specific areas. But perhaps it isn’t possible not to focus on some subset, but maybe it should be done knowingly and with admission of the risks involved.


* Introspection:
What are the types of introspection, and what are the risks and benefits of them? When is introspection self-indulgent? What sorts of information are the goal of introspection? How does concept of self affect introspection?
One observation follows as example.
The given purpose of introspection is usually to learn about oneself. There are a few reasons one might do that. Perhaps knowledge of one’s personality and nature make it easier to live life, allowing one to predict how one will respond to new situations, and to know how best to influence yourself to accomplish your goals, and to know what goals to have in the first place. These are all very practical reasons. A second type of reason might be because one is an inherently interesting thing, and one might track one’s moods and sentiments for the same reason one might track tides of history. This latter reason may be true, but it risks sending a person into paraxisms of self-absorbtion that have no inherent limit.
The solution I would think is to first, focus on introspection of the first type, the identification of practical information about oneself that allows one to better navigate life at one’s helm. And regarding the second type, I would think that the following perspective might help. Regarding the workings of a company, not every event is so noteworthy in and of itself, but a given fact might illustrate a general truth about companies and business and so be notable, or, a given fact might be significant in the history of the company because affects the company’s function as a company. Similarly, as one notices one’s own minutia and is distinguishing between the notable and the irrelevant, one might seek to notice and remember those things that illustrate a human trait in general, or which meaningfully effect a person’s quest to achieve their function. That will reduce significantly the amount of information that is relevant, and even that information that one does notice, one is interested to learn about humanity generally or to optimize one’s operation practically, not to wallow in self-absorption for its own sake.


* Jokes:
What’s wrong with self-centered people? They’re very ich-y.
What do you call a kali that’s not connected to any other kali, and you put an egg in it? There’s no special name for it, it’s just an egg-in-a-zach.
What do you call an ox that doesn’t attack anyone? Gore-nisht.
What do you call someone who only knows one letter of the aleph-beis and is embarassed about it? He’s an ois-mench.
What’s an alchoholic’s favorite pasuk of tehilim? M’yayin yavo ezri.


* Judgement:
Judgement broadly speaking is when we try to evaluate whether another person is doing well or poorly.
The primary difficulty is that a person is a success or failure relative to their effort and not natural abilities, and yet it is almost impossible to know whether a person is able to do better than they are.
You may see evidence that a person is lazy, but that laziness might be a result of bad education or demotivating experiences.
You may think you are praise-worthy for how much you do, but you may have ulterior motives another person doesn’t have.
Everyone seems very confident that people are weaker today than they were previously, but things like secularism and low self-esteem from a globalized world may be more uncomfortable than physical poverty and so I’m not sure the claim is so obvious.
In general it is best to assume one doesn’t know what others are capable of, but the ramifications of this idea are very broad and can be difficult to fully integrate into one’s thoughts and practices.


* Kabalah:
I’d like to find someone to ask the following.
I understand how in Toras Niglah you can have someone like the Ketzos or R Chaim say a chiddush that other people see is correct and are mekbel, but when we say the Arizal said new things in Kabalah and that the dor was mekabel them, in what sense are there new things in Kabalah, and how can a dor that didn’t have a mesora for them verify that they are correct? Perhaps both are a type of ruach hakodesh, but I haven’t seen it said anywhere.


* Kavod:
Kavod is the concept in Judaism of a person wanting and receiving honor, praise, and having esteem in the eyes of others.
The desire for kavod is probably 
Is doing something for kavod wrong? When is it problematic and when not?


* Low Self-esteem:
Low self-esteem is a prevalent phenomena that affects most areas of a person’s life.
Low self-esteem can:
- Make it difficult or uncomfortable for someone to notice the positive qualities of peers.
- Make it harder to enjoy interactions with people and with Hashem.
- Make annoyances more bothersome.
A person can feel small without feeling guilt or regret for anything. [[Doesn’t entail regret|(more)]]
There are many reasons why low self-esteem is prevalent in today’s world. [[Modern prevalence|(more)]]

Doesn’t entail regret:
Low self-esteem is not necessarily the same thing as feeling one is a moral or practical failure.
Feelings of guilt, e.g, entail that I feel I have done something wrong which I could have avoided.
But low self-esteem, by contrast, is just the belief that one is small or insignificant, and doesn’t necessarily entail that one things one did anything wrong, or that things could have been otherwise.
Low self-esteem is less an analyitical opinion that one is “bad” than a sensory-level picture of reality in which one is small or lacking value, and so it is hard to remove without changing one’s perception of the world and one’s place in it.

Modern prevalence:
There are many aspects of the modern world that contribute to low self-esteem:
- Globalization means there is more competition and so it is harder to be important and needed, economically or communally.
- Corporatization means that the impact and role of the individual is smaller, and less autonomy means one’s contribution to success is smaller.
- Technology makes many tasks easier, leading a person to have produced a smaller portion of the outcome.
- Communications technology makes us more aware of the accomplishments of other people.
- Media proliferation makes it easier to broadcast norms and expectations of large groups.
- Postmodernism increases people-analysis and identifies more areas to find fault.
- Contemporary psychological problems can make a person less capable without being correctly identified
- Exposure to secularism dullens the emotional reality of one’s theological significance, even for religious people.
There are many other examples and related topics.


* Manipulation:
Manipulation is a broad subject with many examples and categories.
Manipulation in general when a person tries to get a person to do something by means other than openly disclosing their preference.
For example, rather than argue ploni should do something generous, a manipulative person might act as if it is widely known others consider ploni ungenerous, whereas the manipulator is on his side and knows the truth.
A manipulator might believe it necessary because ploni would not act in his own interests if reasoned with. Whether this is or isn’t sometimes true, such a manipulator probably over time dullens his sense of the tragedy of having to use dishonesty to remove another person’s bechira. Additionally, such a person is at risk of ignoring ways they benefit from underestimating the person’s ability to be reasoned with and make decisions independently.
A less sophisticated example is a manipulator who simply himself pretends he thinks another crazy for doing a normal thing that is disadvantageous to the manipulator.
There are many other permutations and situations here the subject comes up.


* Marriage:
Marriage is a complex topic with many subtopics.
The Jewish conception of marriage has roles for men and women.
One aspect is the idea of the woman as having a supporting role. [[Wife’s supporting role|(more)]]

Wife’s supporting role:
A wife in Yiddishkeit has a supporting role with less authority.
A corresponding responsibility of the husband is to take an active responsibility for the physical and emotional well-being of her in a way that is not expected reciprocally.
You find men who expect a wife to be supporting and submissive, but who don’t take full and active responsibility for their well-being, and the mistake is to think that the two aspects are unrelated, as if to say “I may be being a _bad_ husband, but you’re being _not_ a wife,” etc.
There are cultures and hashkafas where the roles are less distinct, usually expecting less submission from the wife, and correspondingly less singular responsibility from the husband, and there may be couples whose personality types or backgrounds make them fall differently on the spectrum.
This is analogous to how a husband’s ownership of his wife’s property is conditional on his financially supporting her, whereas it is also permissible to have neither.


* Memory:
What are the kinds of memory? What behaviors/experiences produce what kinds of memories?
Complex cognitive behavior is usually the verbalization and recording of metadata to allow dumb access rather than memory “doing” analysis. [[Does not perform analysis|(more)]]

Does not perform analysis:
Memory only stores data and cannot perform analysis like inference.
Let’s say I notice ploni is hard working, and am surprised because he is usually lazy. This comparison did not occur because “memory” noticed the contradiction, rather, I had previously labeled Ploni as “lazy,” and so when my parser attributed to him the descriptor “hard-working,” this produced a patent contradiction between the stored value and current label. This would be detected in working memory which has access to the stored and new values, all memory is doing is dumb recall of the previous descriptions of ploni.


* Middos:
One question in middos is when someone is turning a midda into a shita.
Eg, how intensity is not necessarily integrity, but is rather a personality type.
Another idea regarding middos is that middos correspond to types of narration, eg, a chesedik person sees a yasam and an almana, whereas someone else might see someone sitting in their seat. A corollary of this is that one can produce in oneself a middah by producing narration of their life that is biased towards that middah.


* Open-mindedness:
“Open-mindedness” can refer to a variety of qualities.
One meaning is someone who is happy to consider the views of others even if contradictory to his own.
This can be positive as one can double check one’s own conclusions.
On the other hand, such a perspective can lead someone to take the middle ground between one‘s view and other’s from caution, and this can cause a person not to act in accordance with either view to their detriment.
Additionally, “open-mindedness” can cause a person to be overly hesitant to decide what they think is happening in areas of subtlety and act accordingly so long as there is any other possibility, which leaves them open to manipulation as others can mistreat them while leaving some plausible deniability, and the open-minded person will be too self-doubting to label the person harmful and evade further harm.
One eitza for such a person is to realize that his deciding that a person is e.g. malicious doesn’t require making a general fact claim; to _his mind_, the harm seems intentional, so _to his mind_, he needs precautions, but need not “hold” the person is malicious, and can remain “open” to the possibility his judgement is wrong.
Incidentally this is probably closer to the meaning of _dan l’chaf zchus_ than being stam charitable – not that one presume others are in fact well meaning, but rather that one judge others based on the available evidence and act accordingly, while simultaneously withholding total certainty that one has perceived things correctly.


* Parenting:
What parenting practices produce what qualities in children?
For example, what qualities produce idealism and agency? Perhaps asking a child how they think things should be, so as to _mechayev_ them, and asking what they notice and what opinions their observations lead them to.


* Personality:
What are the types of personality, and what descriptions depict them?
Specifically, what terms for personality traits are commonly used and understood, and which traits seem correlated with one another?
Which traits are usually the product of upbringing and culture, and which are usually genetic?
What theories of personality exist, what traits do they identify, and how can we make a more general merger of them?


* Postmodernism:
Postmodernism is a catch-all phrase for a cluster of different views and preferences.
Postmodernism is characterized by:
- A presumption that stam authority is from coercion
- A distaste for styles of speech and writing that presume authority
- A skepticism of simple descriptions and stories being accurate
- A hyperfocus on biases, and the impact of vantage point on perspective
- A disdain for hypocrisy more than other vices
There also are other aspects that can be further examined.


* Power:
The topic of power is related to many discussions.
One example is the perspective in postmodern taste that the desire for power is bad and embarrassing.
Lechora this is a positive development.
At this point, it is almost a shock when one runs into a member of the old school who is not at all embarrassed, “I want to be able to make other people do what I want,” k’pshuto. Maybe everyone used to be that way? Or perhaps authority encroached upon is clasped greater.


* Self-esteem:
Self-esteem is a common topic of discussion today.
It can be discussed as a general entity or phenomena.
High self-esteem gives a person motivation to accomplish more things, and hold themselves to a high personal standard. [[High Self-esteem|(more)]]
Low self-esteem causes a person to become self-conscious and jealous and to make poor choices which makes achievement more unlikely. Low self-esteem is sometimes a reaction to reality but can be a result of unhealthy perspectives as well. [[Low self-esteem|(more)]]


* Selfishness:
There are various distinct traits and behaviors that are called selfishness.
A person who is selfish might be unable to tolerate even slight deviations from their train of thought and what is important or interesting to them.
A person might on the other hand be very sophisticated and good with people, and sees how being warm and considerate helps him, but practically speaking only considers things that benefit him as being worth his time. This type of selfishness is harder to spot because the person might actually pay attention to other people’s needs and help them.


* Taivas:
A person has many taivas depending on biology and stage of life.
Knowing what taivas a person might have is important for identifying ulterior motives.
Taivas can be channeled towards positive behaviors, even those indirectly related to the taiva. [[Channeling|(more)]]

Channeling:
Taivas can be helpful if directed towards useful goals.
Obviously they can be directed towards related goals, like hunger motivating a person to find food.
But taivas can also be directed towards indirectly related goals. For example, a person might have a taiva for money, and they might channel this towards motivation to do school work or repetitive business tasks.
The primary difficulty in channeling a taiva is that the base drive lacks an abstract sense of what things might assist in attaining the desired thing. It can help to verbalize and visualize the connection between the behavior and the goal. However, sometimes we do get involved in means that do not so clearly contribute to the given end, and losing motivation for them is a desired behavior.
This sort of self-talk is similar to a prime minister argues to different parties how cooperation with rival parties in the coalition will deliver them outcomes more valuable to them than what they’ll give up.


* Technology:
There are many things to discuss regarding technology.
One example is as follows.
The Jewish world has become rightly zahir regarding exposure to inappropriate materials. Separately, the medium of technology, independent of content, the interactivity and stimulation at unpredictable times etc, presents a different challenge which we understand now to produce long-term affects on concentration.
So I would pose a shiala like this: which is worse, exposure to inappropriate material at discrete concentrated periods, or exposure to “parve” stimulation at a constant rate?
I would say a svara for the latter being worse. I would think that a person being exposed to inappropriate material is like a davar tamei with a mikvah, it might be very tamei, but one has the keylim to be osek in Torah and Tefilah and be mekusher to kedusha. Ma sh’ain kein a person who harms their concentration and da’as, which is itself the very means of being miskadesh and mistaher, making the latter like a davar tahor in a place without a mikvah,


* Yeshivishkeit:
What are the various things meant by the term “yeshivish”?
What qualities identify members of the yeshiva world, and which are coincidental?
How do the morays of the contemporary yeshiva world relate to the ideals of the Torah?


* Yiddishkeit:
There are a lot of topics related to Yiddishkeit.
One topic would be the different ways a person can understand the nature of Yiddishkeit.
For example, a person might identify with a culture that does a lot of mitzvos, learning, chesed, etc, and he might truly try to excel, but what he is excelling at is conformity to the ideal member of the group.
Another person might derive from first principles what behaviors and outcomes Yiddishkeit wants, and might try to maximize those outcomes. This latter person might identify novel ways to accomplish the goals of Yiddishkeit and may be more intrinsically motivated because goal-oriented, but is probably more likely to be wrong than someone conforming to the ideal of a larger group.
