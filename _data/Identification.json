So long as they also are yotze in bein adam l’chavero, is there any problem with that? It seems to me that there is no way for a group to identify with a subset of Yiddishkeit and not have the other parts suffer, because to identify with some subset of Yiddishkeit explicitly is to disidentify with the rest of yiddishkeit, ie, not to say one doesn’t have to be yotze, but to say that one’s membership in the group is not jeapordized by extremely lack-luster performance in them. What is the alternative? Perhaps to only have groups that identify with the entirety of Yiddishkeit and allow individuals and smaller groups to focus on specific areas. But perhaps it isn’t possible not to focus on some subset, but maybe it should be done knowingly and with admission of the risks involved.","type":"text"}]}}
