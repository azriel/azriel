{"displayTopicName":"Manipulation","topicTokens":[{"text":"Manipulation","type":"text"}],"paragraphsBySubtopic":{"Manipulation":[{"text":"Manipulation is a broad subject with many examples and categories.\nManipulation in general when a person tries to get a person to do something by means other than openly disclosing their preference.\nFor example, rather than argue ploni should do something generous, a manipulative person might act as if it is widely known others consider ploni ungenerous, whereas the manipulator is on his side and knows the truth.\nA manipulator might believe it necessary because ploni would not act in his own interests if reasoned with. Whether this is or isn’t sometimes true, such a manipulator probably over time dullens his sense of the tragedy of having to use dishonesty to remove another person’s bechira. Additionally, such a person is at risk of ignoring ways they benefit from underestimating the person’s ability to be reasoned with and make decisions independently.\nA less sophisticated example is a manipulator who simply himself pretends he thinks another crazy for doing a normal thing that is disadvantageous to the manipulator.\nThere are many other permutations and situations here the subject comes up.","type":"text"}]}}
