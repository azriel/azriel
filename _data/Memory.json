This comparison did not occur because “memory” noticed the contradiction, rather, I had previously labeled Ploni as “lazy,” and so when my parser attributed to him the descriptor “hard-working,” this produced a patent contradiction between the stored value and current label. This would be detected in working memory which has access to the stored and new values, all memory is doing is dumb recall of the previous descriptions of ploni.","type":"text"}]}}
