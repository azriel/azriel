Gratitude:
BE"H I’d like to sketch out here aspects of life that everyone benefits from, eg:
- Every invention we rely on, what life was like before, the details, why the invention wasn’t a feit acompli
- Aspects of nature that we rely on eg crops and how much it would cost to engineer replacements
- Aspects of daily life that are pleasant and enumerating them, and ways they could be worse
Etc. In conjunction, a person can make certain types of personal lists:
- The historical arc that led to them and their family being where they are now
- At each stage of life, things that went positively
Etc.
