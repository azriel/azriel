Judgement:
Judgement broadly speaking is when we try to evaluate whether another person is doing well or poorly.
The primary difficulty is that a person is a success or failure relative to their effort and not natural abilities, and yet it is almost impossible to know whether a person is able to do better than they are.
You may see evidence that a person is lazy, but that laziness might be a result of bad education or demotivating experiences.
You may think you are praise-worthy for how much you do, but you may have ulterior motives another person doesn't have.
In general it is best to assume one doesn’t know what others are capable of, but the ramifications of this idea are very broad and can be difficult to fully integrate into one’s thoughts and practices.
