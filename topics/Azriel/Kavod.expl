Kavod:
Kavod is the concept in Judaism of a person wanting and receiving honor, praise, and having esteem in the eyes of others.
The desire for kavod is probably the desire to be needed being unmet and becoming more extreme, like hunger for unhealthy food.
Is doing something for kavod wrong? When is it problematic and when not?
