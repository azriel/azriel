Marriage:
Marriage is a complex topic with many subtopics.
The Jewish conception of marriage has roles for men and women.
One aspect is the idea of the woman as having a supporting role and less authority.
A corresponding responsibility of the husband is to take active responsibility for the physical and emotional well-being of everyone in the household.
You find men who expect a wife to be supporting and submissive, but who don’t take full and active responsibility for their well-being, and the mistake is to think that the two aspects are unrelated, as if to say “I may be being a _bad_ husband, but you’re being _not_ a wife,” etc.
There are cultures and hashkafas where the roles are less distinct, usually expecting less submission from the wife, and correspondingly less singular responsibility from the husband.
