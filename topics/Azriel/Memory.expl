Memory:
What are the kinds of memory? What behaviors/experiences produce what kinds of memories?
Complex cognitive behavior is usually the verbalization and recording of metadata to allow dumb access rather than memory “doing” analysis. [[Does not perform analysis|(More)]]

Does not perform analysis:
Memory only stores data and cannot perform analysis like inference.
Let’s say I notice ploni is hard working, and am surprised because he is usually lazy. This comparison did not occur because “memory” noticed the contradiction, rather, I had previously labeled Ploni as “lazy,” and so when my parser attributed to him the descriptor “hard-working,” this produced a patent contradiction between the stored value and current label. This would be detected in working memory which has access to the stored and new values, all memory is doing is dumb recall of the previous descriptions of ploni.
