Middos:
One question in middos is when someone is turning a midda into a shita.
Eg, how intensity is not necessarily integrity, but is rather a personality type.
Another idea regarding middos is that middos correspond to types of narration, eg, a chesedik person sees a yasam and an almana, whereas someone else might see someone sitting in their seat. A corollary of this is that one can produce in oneself a middah by producing narration of their life that is biased towards that middah.
