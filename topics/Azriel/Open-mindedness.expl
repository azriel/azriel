Open-mindedness:
“Open-mindedness” can refer to a variety of qualities.
One meaning is someone who is happy to consider the views of others even if contradictory to his own.
This can be positive as one can double check one’s own conclusions.
On the other hand, such a perspective can lead someone to take the middle ground between one‘s view and other’s from caution, and this can cause a person not to act in accordance with either view to their detriment.
Additionally, “open-mindedness” can cause a person to be overly hesitant to decide what they think is happening in areas of subtlety and act accordingly so long as there is any other possibility, which leaves them open to manipulation as others can mistreat them while leaving some plausible deniability, and the open-minded person will be too self-doubting to label the person harmful and evade further harm.
One eitza for such a person is to realize that his deciding that a person is e.g. malicious doesn’t require making a general fact claim; to _his mind_, the harm seems intentional, so _to his mind_, he needs precautions, but need not “hold” the person is malicious, and can remain “open” to the possibility his judgement is wrong.
Incidentally this is probably closer to the meaning of _dan l’chaf zchus_ than being stam charitable – not that one presume others are in fact well meaning, but rather that one judge others based on the available evidence and act accordingly, while simultaneously withholding total certainty that one has perceived things correctly.
