Open-mindedness:
“Open-mindedness” can refer to a variety of qualities.
One meaning is someone who is happy to consider the views of others even if contradictory to his own.

On the other hand, such a perspective can lead someone to take the middle ground between one's view and other's from caution, and this can cause a person not to act in accordance with either view,
