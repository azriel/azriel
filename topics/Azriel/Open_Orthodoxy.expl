Open Orthodoxy:
One can ask, is “open Orthodoxy” a stira, or merely wrong? 
I.e., is there something inherently contradictory about preferring Orthodox practices when they are amenable to one’s  freikeit, but not feeling beholden to them when it does?
You could say they hold of Orthodoxy altz historical authenticity from nostalgia and the gaiva of being authentic, and they’d prefer authenticity except where it’s soser their actual religion.
So obviously it’s an error in general, but I’m not sure it’s a stira specifically.
