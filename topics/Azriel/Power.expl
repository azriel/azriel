Power:
The topic of power is related to many discussions.
One example is the perspective in postmodern taste that the desire for power is bad and embarrassing.
Lechora this is a positive development.
At this point, it is almost a shock when one runs into a member of the old school who is not at all embarrassed, “I want to be able to make other people do what I want,” k’pshuto. Maybe everyone used to be that way? Or perhaps authority encroached upon is clasped greater.
