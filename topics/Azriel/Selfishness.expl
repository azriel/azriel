Selfishness:
There are various distinct traits and behaviors that are called selfishness.
A person who is selfish might be unable to tolerate even slight deviations from their train of thought and what is important or interesting to them.
A person might on the other hand be very sophisticated and good with people, and sees how being warm and considerate helps him, but practically speaking only considers things that benefit him as being worth his time. This type of selfishness is harder to spot because the person might actually pay attention to other peopleâ€™s needs and help them.
