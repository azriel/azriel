Technology:
There are many things to discuss regarding technology.
One example is as follows.
The Jewish world has become rightly zahir regarding exposure to inappropriate materials. Separately, the medium of technology, independent of content, the interactivity and stimulation at unpredictable times etc, presents a different challenge which we understand now to produce long-term affects on concentration.
So I would pose a shiala like this: which is worse, exposure to inappropriate material at discrete concentrated periods, or exposure to “parve” stimulation at a constant rate?
I would say a svara for the latter being worse. I would think that a person being exposed to inappropriate material is like a davar tamei with a mikvah, it might be very tamei, but one has the keylim to be osek in Torah and Tefilah and be mekusher to kedusha. Ma sh’ain kein a person who harms their concentration and da’as, which is itself the very means of being miskadesh and mistaher, making the latter like a davar tahor in a place without a mikvah,
