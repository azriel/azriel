Zionism:
There are various topics and questions related to the idea of Zionism.
One example is, taking on like the anti-Zionists, what is the significance of tzioni mesiras nefesh for the medina?
I.e., is it philosophically misguided but reflects positively on the person as stam sacrifice for one’s beliefs?
Or is the taos sh’bo oker any moral significance?
If like the first tzad that stam idealism is positive, what if it was done from peer pressure or a desire for kavod, but in a case of major tzar? Is real tzar for one’s beliefs but from the wrong motivations still laudable?
What if it is done b’tzar, not from self-interest, but from a baser drive, not a tzioni ahavas Yisroel, but a desire e.g. to revenge affronts to the medina altz stam pride? Is that worth anything?
