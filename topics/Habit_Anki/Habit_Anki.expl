You can't just say "if X do Y", because "X" is just a linguistic construct that can be used l'mafrea to check if something counts, but l'chatchila is not enough to change your reaction to the sum of things that have that description, whereas if you build up a category from many ostensive examples, if you memorize that something is true of that set, it actually will come to mind in the given circumstance, provided it looks similar to the rest. Because what we really want is not just a "do this" but a complex trigger and a complex procedure upon trigger.
