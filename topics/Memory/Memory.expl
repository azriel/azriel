Why does a property bring to mind an entity in STM, but I can't label an entity "thing I want to remember", which is also a property?

Why does a memory palace work such that I can associate a more familiar thing to a less familiar thing in one try, whereas in other areas like habits doing so is very difficult?

Why is it possible to use a person as a cue, and then have them trigger a very specific fact about them, eg a person and the name of the street they live on? Perhaps if that is the only thing about them in STM that's what it triggers, so the person is a way to list threads, and with the person you can STM hit the aspect.
