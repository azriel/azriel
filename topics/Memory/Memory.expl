Why does a property bring to mind an entity in STM, but I can't label an entity "thing I want to remember", which is also a property?

Why does a memory palace work such that I can associate a more familiar thing to a less familiar thing in one try, whereas in other areas like habits doing so is very difficult?

Why is it possible to use a person as a cue, and then have them trigger a very specific fact about them, eg a person and the name of the street they live on? Perhaps if that is the only thing about them in STM that's what it triggers, so the person is a way to list threads, and with the person you can STM hit the aspect.

The way in which if I try to associate something in my mind with "brush teeth and floss", then that will get stored as "do [dental related things]", and then when I try to remember it, once I produce one such thing, I will think I've remembered everything, and so remembering multi-part ideas requires remembering clearly-incomplete images that beg questions.
